## Simple Approach To Game Design:

```
Intention -> Execution
```

**Intention:** What are we trying to do? Expect to iterate.

**Execution:** Try to match our Intention as best we can.

## Termaial Game Design Intention:

**Player Experience:**
Like an old school hacker

**Core Mechanic:**
Anagram guessing game.
as ```lbaet = table```

**Core game loop:**
Player is shown scrambled word and asked to guess. They have as many guesses as they need. When guessed accurately, they "Win".
